# Machine Learning Application Project

Project Objective: Train a Machine Learning model to predict the outcome of March Madness basketball games given two teams and varying stats for each team.

Files: Most of the files in this repository where used for various data cleaning and data combining tasks. The training and optimization of the various machine learning models exists in the Pipeline ML Application Jupyter Notebook. 

For more information on the project please see the project report pdf in the repository.

### Overview of repository 
Inside the March Madness folder, we have data collected from three different sources, including standard tournament data, season data, and aggregated tournament data with unique features. 

Python scripts are used to clean and create CSV files that we then combine into our final data set. 

The joinData notebook contains the code that combines the CSV files into finalData.csv, as well as our initial attempts at modeling the data using SVM. 

We also have the Pipeline ML Application notebook, which uses finalData.csv for exploratory data analysis and the creation of a pipeline to train and evaluate our models.
